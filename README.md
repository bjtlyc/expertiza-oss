----------------

We've had many contributors in the past who have used a wide variety of ruby coding styles. It's a mess, and we're trying to unify it.

All new files/contributions should:

 * Use unix line endings (Windows users: configure git to use [autocrlf](http://help.github.com/line-endings))
 * Indent with 2 spaces (no tabs; configure your editor) both in ruby and erb
 * Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) style for syntax, formatting, and naming

When editing existing files:

 * Keep the existing tabbing (use tabs instead of spaces in files that already use tabs everywhere; otherwise use spaces)
 * Keep the existing line ending style (dos/unix)
 * Follow the Ruby style Guide on code you add or edit, as above

Please do no go crazy changing old code to match these guidelines; it will just create lots of potential merge conflicts.
Applying style guidelines to code you add and modify is good enough. :-)
